"""The source registry (spec 13.1) and the search vocabulary (spec 14).

Two honesty mechanisms live here:

1. **Status tiers.** A country is not covered because it appears in this file.
   It is covered when it has a working connector, a health check and a passing
   test. `candidate_official_sources` exists so the roadmap can be published
   without lying about the present.
2. **Vocabulary as data.** Search terms live here, never inside a prompt, so
   they are reviewable, testable and diffable.
